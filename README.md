## PVEDiscordDark
PVEDiscordDark is a  CSS 'theme' for the Proxmox Web UI. It was made with Discord's color scheme. Although ~99.8% (Psst, totally not a random percentage) of the Web UI has been darkened. There are some graphs that are still white because their background colors are defined in javascript, there is an experimental [feature](https://github.com/Weilbyte/PVEDiscordDark/tree/master/serverside/jsmod) to change these.

You can check the 'previews' folder in the repo to check out how some stuff look (without the JS modification)
